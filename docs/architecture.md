# MCP Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) system provides a flexible framework for managing agent interactions, policy enforcement, and rule validation. This document outlines the key architectural components and their interactions.

## System Components

### 1. Agent Interaction Engine

The Agent Interaction Engine serves as the central coordination point for all MCP operations. It manages:

- Communication between agents
- Policy enforcement
- Request routing
- Response formatting

### 2. Host LLM Inference

The Host LLM Inference component handles:

- Large language model inference requests
- Context management
- Response generation
- Model parameter configuration

### 3. Memory Store

The Memory Store provides:

- Persistent storage for conversation history
- Context retrieval for agents
- State management across sessions

### 4. Tool Executor

The Tool Executor enables:

- Dynamic tool registration and discovery
- Tool execution with appropriate permissions
- Result formatting and validation

## Rule System Architecture

### Regelpr√ºfung zur Laufzeit (Runtime Rule Checking)

The runtime rule checking system validates that policies and operations comply with defined rules during system execution. This ensures that all components operate within their defined constraints and capabilities.

#### Components

1. **Rule Definition (`config/rules/*.rules.yaml`)**
   - YAML files defining constraints and requirements
   - Organized by domain (structure, naming, capabilities, etc.)
   - Each rule has a unique identifier and validation criteria

2. **Runtime Rule Checker (`mcp_agent_interaction_engine/runtime_rules.py`)**
   - Loads rule definitions from configuration files
   - Validates policies against rules
   - Returns detailed violation information
   - Supports both full validation and targeted rule checking

3. **Rules API (`mcp_agent_interaction_engine/rules_api.py`)**
   - Exposes rule validation through REST endpoints
   - `GET /mcp/rules` - Lists all available rules
   - `POST /mcp/rules/check` - Validates a policy against rules
   - Integrates with the main API gateway

4. **CLI Interface (`scripts/mcp_cli.py`)**
   - Provides command-line access to rule validation
   - Supports checking policies against rules
   - Formats results for human readability

#### Validation Process

1. Rules are loaded from configuration files
2. Policies are parsed and normalized
3. Each policy element is checked against applicable rules
4. Violations are collected and returned
5. Results can be accessed via API, CLI, or programmatically

#### Integration Points

- **API Gateway**: Rules API endpoints are registered with the main API gateway
- **Policy Application**: Policies are validated before being applied to the system
- **Runtime Checks**: Operations can be validated against rules during execution

## Data Flow

1. Client sends request to API Gateway
2. Request is validated against applicable rules
3. If valid, request is routed to appropriate component
4. Component processes request according to its capabilities
5. Response is formatted and returned to client

## Configuration

The system is configured through various YAML and JSON files:

- `config/mcp_register.yaml`: Component registration
- `config/mcp_capabilities.yaml`: Component capabilities
- `config/mcp_permissions.json`: Access control settings
- `config/policies/*.policy.yaml`: Operational policies
- `config/rules/*.rules.yaml`: Validation rules

## Runtime State

The system maintains runtime state in JSON files:

- `runtime_state/state_context.json`: Current context
- `runtime_state/state_memory.json`: Memory store state
- `runtime_state/state_policy.json`: Active policy
- `runtime_state/state_status.json`: System status

## Security Model

The MCP system implements a layered security model:

1. **Rule Validation**: Ensures operations comply with defined constraints
2. **Policy Enforcement**: Applies operational policies to all actions
3. **Permission Checking**: Validates access rights for operations
4. **Capability Constraints**: Limits component actions to defined capabilities

## Extensibility

The system is designed for extensibility through:

- Dynamic component registration
- Pluggable rule definitions
- Custom policy creation
- Tool registration API
